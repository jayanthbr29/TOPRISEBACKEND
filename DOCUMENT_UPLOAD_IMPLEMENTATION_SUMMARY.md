## 🚀 Order Integration

### Created Order Structure
When an order is created from a document, it includes:

```javascript
{
  orderId: "TOP-ORD-1729001500",
  status: "Confirmed",
  items: [...],
  order_Amount: 72500,
  customerDetails: {...},
  paymentType: "COD",
  type_of_delivery: "Express",
  
  // Special fields linking back to document
  created_from_document: true,
  document_upload_id: "671234567890abcdef123456"
}
```

### Order Lifecycle
The created order follows the **standard order cycle**:

1. ✅ **Confirmed** - Order created from document
2. 📦 **Assigned** - Assigned to dealer
3. 🔍 **Scanning** - Dealer scans items
4. 📦 **Packed** - Items packed
5. 🚚 **Shipped** - Order dispatched with tracking
6. ✅ **Delivered** - Order completed
