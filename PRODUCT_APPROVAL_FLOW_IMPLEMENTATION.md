# Product Approval Flow Implementation

## üéØ **Overview**

Implemented a comprehensive product approval system that requires products uploaded by non-Super-admin users to be approved by Inventory Admin or Super Admin before they become live. This ensures quality control and maintains data integrity across the platform.

## ‚úÖ **Key Features**

### **Role-Based Approval Logic**
- **Super-admin**: Products are automatically approved upon creation
- **All other roles** (Inventory-Admin, Inventory-Staff, Dealer, etc.): Products require manual approval
- **Approvers**: Only Super-admin and Inventory-Admin can approve/reject products

### **Approval Workflow**
1. **Product Creation**: Products created by non-Super-admin users are set to "Pending" status
2. **Notification**: Inventory Admin and Super Admin are notified of pending products
3. **Review Process**: Approvers can review and approve/reject products individually or in bulk
4. **Status Update**: Approved products become live, rejected products are marked with reasons
5. **User Notification**: Product creators are notified of approval/rejection decisions

## üîß **Technical Implementation**

### **Modified Files**

#### **1. Product Controller (`services/product-service/src/controller/product.js`)**

**Enhanced `bulkUploadProducts` function:**
- Added role-based approval logic
- Enhanced notification system for pending products
- Added approval tracking in bulk sessions
- Improved response messages for approval status

**New Approval Endpoints:**
- `getPendingProducts`: Get all products requiring approval
- `approveSingleProduct`: Approve a single product
- `rejectSingleProduct`: Reject a single product with reason
- `bulkApproveProducts`: Approve multiple products at once
- `bulkRejectProducts`: Reject multiple products with reason
- `getApprovalStats`: Get approval statistics

#### **2. Product Routes (`services/product-service/src/route/product.js`)**

**New Routes Added:**
```javascript
// Get pending products for approval
GET /api/products/pending

// Approve single product
PATCH /api/products/approve/:productId

// Reject single product
PATCH /api/products/reject/:productId

// Bulk approve products
PATCH /api/products/bulk/approve

// Bulk reject products
PATCH /api/products/bulk/reject

// Get approval statistics
GET /api/products/approval/stats
```

#### **3. Product Model (`services/product-service/src/models/productModel.js`)**

**Added Fields:**
- `created_by_role`: Tracks the role of the user who created the product

#### **4. Product Bulk Session Model (`services/product-service/src/models/productBulkSessionModel.js`)**

**Added Fields:**
- `created_by_role`: Tracks the role of the user who created the bulk session
- `requires_approval`: Boolean flag indicating if approval is required

```

## üîê **Authorization & Security**

### **Role-Based Access Control**
- **Super-admin**: Full access to all approval functions
- **Inventory-Admin**: Full access to all approval functions
- **Other roles**: Can only create products (require approval)

### **Audit Logging**
All approval actions are logged with:
- User ID of the approver/rejector
- Timestamp of the action
- Reason for approval/rejection
- Product details
- Change history

### **Notifications**
- **Pending Products**: Inventory Admin and Super Admin are notified
- **Approved Products**: Product creator is notified
- **Rejected Products**: Product creator is notified with rejection reason

## üß™ **Testing**

### **Test Script: `test-product-approval-flow.js`**

The test script covers:
1. **Product creation by non-Super-admin users**
2. **Verification of pending status**
3. **Approval process by Super Admin**
4. **Rejection process with reasons**
5. **Bulk approval operations**
6. **Statistics retrieval**
7. **Auto-approval for Super Admin uploads**

**Run tests:**
```bash
node test-product-approval-flow.js
```

## üìä **Business Logic**

### **Approval Flow**
```
User Uploads Product
        ‚Üì
Check User Role
        ‚Üì
Super-admin? ‚Üí Auto-approve
        ‚Üì No
Set to Pending
        ‚Üì
Notify Approvers
        ‚Üì
Review Process
        ‚Üì
Approve/Reject
        ‚Üì
Update Status
        ‚Üì
Notify Creator
```

### **Status Transitions**
- **Created ‚Üí Pending**: Non-Super-admin upload
- **Created ‚Üí Approved**: Super-admin upload
- **Pending ‚Üí Approved**: Manual approval
- **Pending ‚Üí Rejected**: Manual rejection with reason

## üéØ **Frontend Integration**

### **Pending Products Dashboard**
```javascript
// Get pending products
const getPendingProducts = async (page = 1, limit = 10) => {
  const response = await axios.get(`/api/products/pending?page=${page}&limit=${limit}`, {
    headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
  });
  return response.data;
};

// Approve product
const approveProduct = async (productId, reason) => {
  const response = await axios.patch(`/api/products/approve/${productId}`, {
    reason: reason
  }, {
    headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
  });
  return response.data;
};

// Reject product
const rejectProduct = async (productId, reason) => {
  const response = await axios.patch(`/api/products/reject/${productId}`, {
    reason: reason
  }, {
    headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
  });
  return response.data;
};
```

### **Approval Statistics Widget**
```javascript
// Get approval statistics
const getApprovalStats = async () => {
  const response = await axios.get('/api/products/approval/stats', {
    headers: { 'Authorization': `Bearer ${token}` }
  });
  return response.data;
};
```

## üìù **Configuration**

### **Environment Variables**
No additional environment variables required. The system uses existing JWT configuration.

### **Database Changes**
- Added `created_by_role` field to Product model
- Added `created_by_role` and `requires_approval` fields to ProductBulkSession model

## üîÑ **Migration Notes**

### **Existing Products**
- Existing products will continue to work normally
- No migration required for existing data
- New products will follow the approval flow

### **Backward Compatibility**
- All existing endpoints remain functional
- No breaking changes to existing API contracts
- Enhanced functionality is additive

## üöÄ **Deployment**

### **Steps**
1. Deploy updated product service
2. Restart the service
3. Test approval flow with different user roles
4. Monitor approval statistics
5. Configure notifications if needed

### **Monitoring**
- Monitor approval queue size
- Track approval/rejection rates
- Monitor notification delivery
- Check audit logs for compliance

## üìã **Future Enhancements**

### **Potential Improvements**
1. **Time-based auto-approval**: Auto-approve products after a certain time
2. **Approval workflows**: Multi-level approval processes
3. **Quality scoring**: Automated quality assessment
4. **Approval templates**: Predefined approval/rejection reasons
5. **Bulk operations**: Enhanced bulk approval with filters
6. **Approval delegation**: Allow approvers to delegate approval rights
