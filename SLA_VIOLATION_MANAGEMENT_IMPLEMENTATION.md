  expected_fulfillment_time: { type: Date, required: true },
  actual_fulfillment_time: { type: Date, required: true },
  violation_minutes: { type: Number, required: true },
  resolved: { type: Boolean, default: false },
  notes: String,
  created_at: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
  
  // New fields for enhanced functionality
  contact_history: [{
    contacted_at: { type: Date, default: Date.now },
    contact_method: { type: String, enum: ["notification", "email", "sms", "phone", "all"] },
    custom_message: String,
