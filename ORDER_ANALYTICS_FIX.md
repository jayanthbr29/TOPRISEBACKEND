# Order Service Analytics Fix - Super-admin Role Validation Error

## Issue Description
The order service analytics was throwing validation errors when creating audit logs with the `Super-admin` role:

```
ERROR: Failed to create audit log: AuditLog validation failed: actorRole: `Super-admin` is not a valid enum value for path `actorRole`.
```

Additionally, when trying to retrieve audit logs, the system was throwing:

```
ERROR: Schema hasn't been registered for model "User". Use mongoose.model(name, schema)
```

And the analytics routes were returning "Authentication required" even when headers were passed due to role name mismatches.

**NEW ISSUE**: The analytics routes were also throwing:

```
TypeError: argument handler must be a function
```

This was caused by importing non-existent middleware functions.

## Root Cause
1. **Role Enum Mismatch**: The audit log model (`services/order-service/src/models/auditLog.js`) had an enum mismatch with the user model:
   - **User Model**: Uses `"Super-admin"` (lowercase 'a')
   - **Audit Log Model**: Expected `"Super-Admin"` (uppercase 'A')

2. **User Model Reference Issue**: The audit log model was trying to reference the "User" model which doesn't exist in the order service, causing the schema registration error.

3. **Auth Middleware Role Mapping**: The auth middleware was incorrectly mapping `Super-admin` to `Super Admin` (with a space).

4. **Analytics Routes Role Names**: The analytics routes were using incorrect role names like `"Super Admin"` (with space) instead of `"Super-admin"` (with hyphen).

5. **Route Handler Function Error**: The analytics routes were importing non-existent middleware functions (`authenticate`, `authorizeRoles`) that don't exist in the auth middleware.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated Audit Log Model Enum
**File**: `services/order-service/src/models/auditLog.js`

**Changes**:
- Changed `"Super-Admin"` to `"Super-admin"` to match user model
- Added missing roles: `"User"`, `"Customer-Support"`
- Removed `"Customer"` (not used in user model)
- **Removed User model reference** from `actorId` field

```javascript
actorId: {
  type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
  required: true,
  // Removed: ref: "User"
},

actorRole: {
  type: String,
  required: true,
  enum: [
    "Super-admin",           // ✅ Fixed: lowercase 'a'
    "Fulfillment-Admin",
    "Fulfillment-Staff", 
    "Inventory-Admin",
    "Inventory-Staff",
    "Dealer",
    "User",                  // ✅ Added: missing role
    "Customer-Support",      // ✅ Added: missing role
    "System",
  ],
},
```

### 2. Fixed Auth Middleware Role Mapping
**File**: `services/order-service/src/middleware/authMiddleware.js`

**Changes**:
- Removed incorrect role mapping that was converting `Super-admin` to `Super Admin`
- Now returns the role as-is to maintain consistency with the user model

```javascript
const mapRole = (jwtRole) => {
  // Return the role as-is since the audit log model now matches the user model
  return jwtRole;
};
```

### 3. Enhanced User Service Client
**File**: `services/order-service/src/utils/userServiceClient.js`

**Changes**:
- Added comprehensive user service client methods
- Enhanced error handling for user service communication
- Added methods for single user, bulk users, and dealer information

```javascript
exports.fetchUser = async (userId) => {
  try {
    const response = await axios.get(`${USER_SERVICE_URL}/api/users/${userId}`);
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error(`Failed to fetch user ${userId}:`, error.message);
    return null;
  }
};

exports.fetchUsers = async (userIds) => {
  try {
    if (!userIds || userIds.length === 0) return [];
    
    const response = await axios.post(`${USER_SERVICE_URL}/api/users/bulk`, {
      userIds: userIds
    });
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error(`Failed to fetch users:`, error.message);
    return [];
  }
};
```

### 4. Updated Audit Logger to Use User Service Client
**File**: `services/order-service/src/utils/auditLogger.js`

**Changes**:
- Removed `.populate("actorId", "name email role")` from `getAuditLogs` method
- Added user service client integration to fetch user information via API
- Enhanced error handling for user service communication

```javascript
// Fetch user information for all unique actorIds
const uniqueActorIds = [...new Set(logs.map(log => log.actorId?.toString()))].filter(Boolean);
const usersMap = new Map();

if (uniqueActorIds.length > 0) {
  try {
    const usersData = await userServiceClient.fetchUsers(uniqueActorIds);
    if (usersData && usersData.data) {
      usersData.data.forEach(user => {
        usersMap.set(user._id || user.id, user);
      });
    }
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error("Failed to fetch users for audit logs:", error);
  }
}

// Attach user information to logs
const logsWithUsers = logs.map(log => ({
  ...log,
  actorInfo: usersMap.get(log.actorId?.toString()) || null
}));
```

### 5. Fixed Analytics Routes Role Names and Middleware
**File**: `services/order-service/src/routes/analytics.js`

**Changes**:
- Updated all role names to match the user model format
- Fixed role names in `requireRole` middleware calls
- **Fixed middleware imports** to use only existing functions
- **Added proper authentication** to all protected routes

```javascript
// Before:
const { optionalAuth, authenticate, authorizeRoles } = require("../middleware/authMiddleware");

// After:
const { optionalAuth, requireAuth } = require("../middleware/authMiddleware");

// Before:
requireRole(["Super Admin", "System"]),
requireRole(["Fulfilment Admin", "Super Admin"]),

// After:
requireAuth,
requireRole(["Super-admin", "System"]),
requireAuth,
requireRole(["Fulfillment-Admin", "Super-admin"]),
```

**Fixed Routes**:
- `/api/analytics/audit-logs` - `requireAuth` + `["Super-admin", "System"]`
- `/api/analytics/audit-stats` - `requireAuth` + `["Super-admin", "System"]`
- `/api/analytics/fulfillment` - `requireAuth` + `["Fulfillment-Admin", "Super-admin"]`
- `/api/analytics/inventory` - `requireAuth` + `["Inventory-Admin", "Super-admin"]`
- `/api/analytics/dealer/:dealerId` - `requireAuth` + `["Dealer", "Super-admin", "Fulfillment-Admin"]`
- `/api/analytics/realtime/orders` - `requireAuth`
- `/api/analytics/realtime/alerts` - `requireAuth` + `["Super-admin", "Fulfillment-Admin", "Inventory-Admin"]`
- `/api/analytics/compare` - `requireAuth`

## Testing
Created comprehensive test scripts to verify:
- ✅ Audit logs can be created with `Super-admin` role
- ✅ Audit logger utility works correctly
- ✅ `getAuditLogs` method works without User model error
- ✅ User service client handles errors gracefully
- ✅ All valid roles from user model work properly
- ✅ Analytics routes accept correct role names
- ✅ **Analytics routes load without "argument handler must be a function" errors**
- ✅ **All protected routes require proper authentication**
- ✅ **Routes work correctly with valid authentication headers**

## Impact
- ✅ **Fixes the validation error** for `Super-admin` role
- ✅ **Resolves User model schema error** by removing model reference
- ✅ **Ensures consistency** between user model and audit log model
- ✅ **Maintains backward compatibility** with existing audit logs
- ✅ **Prevents future role mapping issues**
- ✅ **Enables proper user information retrieval** via user service API
- ✅ **Fixes authentication issues** in analytics routes
- ✅ **Corrects role name mismatches** in route authorization
- ✅ **Resolves route handler function errors** by using correct middleware imports
- ✅ **Ensures proper authentication** for all protected analytics endpoints
