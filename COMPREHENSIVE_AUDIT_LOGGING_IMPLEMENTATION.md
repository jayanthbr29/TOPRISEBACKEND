# Comprehensive Audit Logging System Implementation

## Overview

This document describes the complete implementation of a comprehensive audit logging system across all three services (Order Service, Product Service, and User Service) in the TOPRISE backend. The system provides full audit trails and history for all actions, serving as a complete log for administrators.

## Architecture

### Services Covered
1. **Order Service** - Tracks order-related actions, SLA violations, payments, returns, etc.
2. **Product Service** - Tracks product management, inventory, pricing, categories, etc.
3. **User Service** - Tracks user management, authentication, roles, permissions, etc.

### Key Components

#### 1. Audit Log Models
Each service has its own audit log model with service-specific actions:

- **Order Service**: `services/order-service/src/models/auditLog.js`
- **Product Service**: `services/product-service/src/models/auditLog.js`
- **User Service**: `services/user-service/src/models/auditLog.js`

#### 2. Audit Logger Utilities
Each service has a comprehensive audit logger utility:

- **Order Service**: `services/order-service/src/utils/auditLogger.js`
- **Product Service**: `services/product-service/src/utils/auditLogger.js`
- **User Service**: `services/user-service/src/utils/auditLogger.js`

#### 3. Authentication Middleware
JWT-based authentication middleware for all services:

- **Order Service**: `services/order-service/src/middleware/authMiddleware.js`
- **Product Service**: `services/product-service/src/middleware/authMiddleware.js`
- **User Service**: `services/user-service/src/middleware/authMiddleware.js`

#### 4. Audit Controllers
Controllers for managing audit logs and analytics:

- **Order Service**: `services/order-service/src/controllers/analyticsController.js`
- **Product Service**: `services/product-service/src/controller/auditController.js`
- **User Service**: `services/user-service/src/controllers/auditController.js`

#### 5. Audit Routes
API routes for audit log access:

- **Order Service**: `services/order-service/src/routes/analytics.js`
- **Product Service**: `services/product-service/src/route/audit.js`
- **User Service**: `services/user-service/src/routes/audit.js`

## Features

### 1. Comprehensive Action Tracking

#### Order Service Actions

## Implementation Details

### 1. Automatic Audit Logging
All actions are automatically logged using middleware that:
- Captures request details (method, URL, body, query params)
- Records response status and execution time
- Logs user information from JWT tokens
- Handles errors gracefully without breaking main flow

### 2. JWT Authentication Integration
- Decodes JWT tokens to extract user information
- Maps JWT roles to system role format
- Attaches user info to request object
- Supports optional authentication for public endpoints

### 3. Performance Optimization
- Asynchronous logging (non-blocking)
- Database indexing for efficient queries
- Pagination for large result sets
- Caching for frequently accessed data

### 4. Error Handling
- Graceful degradation if audit logging fails
- Detailed error tracking
- Fallback mechanisms
- Comprehensive error reporting

### 5. Data Retention
- Configurable TTL indexes for automatic cleanup
- Separate collections for each service
- Efficient storage with proper indexing
- Backup and recovery procedures

## Usage Examples

### 1. Basic Audit Log Retrieval
```bash
# Get all audit logs with pagination
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5000/api/audit/logs?page=1&limit=50" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"

# Get audit logs for specific action
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5000/api/audit/logs/action/PRODUCT_CREATED" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"

# Get audit logs for specific user
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5000/api/audit/logs/user/USER_ID" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

### 2. Advanced Filtering
```bash
# Get audit logs with date range and category filter
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5000/api/audit/logs?startDate=2024-01-01&endDate=2024-01-31&category=PRODUCT_MANAGEMENT" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"

# Get high severity audit logs
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5000/api/audit/logs?severity=HIGH" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

### 3. Analytics and Reporting

  --output audit_logs.csv
```

### 4. Service-Specific Endpoints
```bash
# Get login attempt logs (User Service)
curl -X GET "http://localhost:5001/api/audit/logs/login-attempts?success=false" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"

curl -X GET "http://localhost:5003/api/analytics/audit-logs?action=SLA_VIOLATION_RECORDED" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_JWT_TOKEN"
```

## Security Considerations
