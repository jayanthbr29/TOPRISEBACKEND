# Product Controller User Name Fix

## Issue
The `editProductSingle` function in the product controller was throwing an error:
```
Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'user_name')
```

## Root Cause
The error occurred because the code was trying to access `user.user_name` when the `user` variable was undefined. This happened when the `find` operation to locate a user by ID didn't find a matching user.

## Fix Applied
Updated all instances where `user?.user_name` was accessed to use a more robust fallback pattern:

### Before:
```javascript
` Product has been updated by ${userId ? user?.user_name : "system"} - ${product.product_name}`
```

### After:
```javascript
` Product has been updated by ${user ? user.user_name || user.username : "system"} - ${product.product_name}`
```

## Changes Made

### 1. `editProductSingle` function (Line ~1850)
- Fixed the notification message to handle undefined user properly
- Added fallback to `user.username` if `user.user_name` is not available

### 2. `rejectProduct` function (Line ~2001)
- Applied the same fix for product rejection notifications

### 3. `approveProduct` function (Line ~2078)
- Applied the same fix for product approval notifications

### 4. `bulkapproveProduct` function (Line ~2552)
- Applied the same fix for bulk product approval notifications

### 5. `bulkrejectProduct` function (Line ~2679)
- Applied the same fix for bulk product rejection notifications

## Pattern Used
The fix uses a robust pattern that:
1. First checks if `user` exists
2. If it exists, tries `user.user_name` first
3. Falls back to `user.username` if `user_name` is not available
4. Falls back to "system" if no user is found

```javascript
user ? user.user_name || user.username : "system"
```

## Benefits
- **Prevents crashes**: No more undefined property access errors
- **Better user experience**: Graceful fallback to alternative user identifiers
- **Consistent behavior**: All notification messages now handle missing user data properly
- **Maintains functionality**: Still shows user information when available

## Testing
After applying this fix, the `editProductSingle` endpoint should work without throwing the "Cannot read properties of undefined" error, even when the user lookup fails or returns undefined.
